# PostrMagic V2 UI Component Gap Analysis

This document tracks UI components that need to be documented in the PostrMagic V2 UI Component Inventory. As components are fully documented in the UI Component Inventory, they will be removed from this gap analysis document.

## Workflow

1. Identify UI components not yet documented in the inventory
2. Document them in this gap analysis with all available details
3. When a component is fully documented in the UI Component Inventory, remove it from this gap analysis
4. Maintain synchronization between both documents

## Verified Components (Now Documented in UI Inventory)

The following components have been fully documented in the UI Component Inventory:

1. **Help Center** (`help.php`)
   - Documented with component breakdown, interactions, and implementation mapping
   - Screenshot captured and referenced: `help-center.png`

2. **API Endpoints Documentation** (`api/media.php`, `api/profile-update.php`)
   - Documented with endpoint breakdown, interactions, and implementation mapping
   - No screenshots needed (API endpoints)

3. **Billing & Subscription Management** (`billing.php`)
   - Documented with component breakdown, interactions, data dependencies, and implementation mapping
   - Screenshot referenced: `user-billing.png`

4. **Admin Analytics Dashboard** (`admin/analytics.php`)
   - Documented with component breakdown, interactions, data dependencies, and implementation mapping
   - Screenshot referenced: `analytics-dashboard.png`

## Previously Missing Components (Now Added to UI Inventory)

The following components were identified as missing from the inventory and have now been added, but may still need complete details:

1. **Authentication UI Components** (`login.php`, `reset-password.php`, `index.php` for registration)
   - Added to UI Component Inventory in Section 7.1
   - Screenshots still needed: `login-page.png`, `password-reset.png`, `registration.png`

2. **Error Pages** (`404.php`, other potential error pages)
   - Added to UI Component Inventory in Section 7.2
   - Screenshot to be created during implementation: `error-404.png`

## Current Gaps

### 1. Components with Incomplete Documentation

The following components exist in the UI Component Inventory but have placeholder content ("to be done later") that needs completion:

*No components with incomplete documentation remaining*

## Next Steps

1. Complete the detailed documentation for components with placeholder content
2. Capture screenshots of all components for inclusion in the UI Component Inventory
3. Continue monitoring for any additional UI components that may be discovered during the implementation process
4. Maintain this document as a living record of any new gaps identified
