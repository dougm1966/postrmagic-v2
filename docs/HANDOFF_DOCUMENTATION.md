# PostrMagic V2 Project Handoff Documentation

## Project Overview

PostrMagic is a web application that uses AI to transform event posters into social media content. The project is currently undergoing a migration from a legacy PHP/XAMPP implementation (V1) to a modern Laravel 12 implementation (V2). This document serves as a handoff guide for AI assistants working on this project.

## Current Project Status [CRITICAL]

The project is currently in the **PRE-IMPLEMENTATION DOCUMENTATION COMPLETE** phase with the following specific status:

1. **UI Component Identification: COMPLETE**
   - All UI components from V1 have been identified and added to the inventory document
   - No missing components remain to be discovered or added to the inventory structure

2. **UI Component Detailed Documentation: COMPLETE**
   - All components are fully documented in the inventory
   - Each component includes detailed information on:
     - Legacy file references
     - Screenshot references (with consistent path formatting)
     - Component breakdown with detailed UI elements
     - Data dependencies
     - V2 Laravel implementation mapping
   - The following components have been recently completed and verified:
     - Billing & Subscription Management: Complete with component breakdown, interaction patterns, data dependencies, screenshots
     - Admin Analytics Dashboard: Complete with component breakdown, interaction patterns, data dependencies, screenshots
     - LLM Settings & Management Interface: Complete with full documentation

3. **Screenshot References: STANDARDIZED**
   - All screenshot references now use a consistent format: `![alt text](./screenshots-of-v1/filename.png)`
   - Some screenshots are marked to be created during V2 buildout:
     - Authentication pages (login-page.png, password-reset.png, registration.png)
     - Error pages (error-404.png)

4. **Build Strategy: COMPLETE**
   - The comprehensive build strategy document has been created
   - Implementation approach, timeline, and technical specifications are fully documented

5. **Gap Analysis: COMPLETE**
   - All identified gaps in documentation have been addressed
   - No components with incomplete documentation remain
   - The gap analysis document is synchronized with the UI Component Inventory

## Next Steps

With all documentation now verified and complete, the project is ready to enter the implementation phase:

1. Set up Laravel development environment
2. Create initial Laravel project structure following documented component organization
3. Begin implementation following the phased approach outlined in the build strategy
4. Create missing screenshots during implementation (authentication and error pages)
5. Update documentation as needed during the development process

## LLM Integration Requirements [NEW]

### Legacy V1 LLM Implementation Structure

  - API Key Management interface for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini
  - Provider Status Dashboard (enabled/disabled, connection status)
  - Prompt Management System with versioning

  - Template System with dynamic content placeholders

### V2 LLM Integration Requirements
- **Provider Support**
  - Maintain support for OpenAI and Anthropic direct integrations
  - Add OpenRouter as a new provider option
  - OpenRouter integration should accept pasted model IDs rather than fixed list
  - Only require provider-level status indicators (not per-model)

- **Process-Specific Configuration**
  - Support configurable LLM assignment to specific processes:
    1. Poster scan (event information extraction)
    2. Content creation (social media posts)
    3. Documentation creation (help articles, FAQs, feature descriptions, pages, emails)
  - Admin UI must show process/model compatibility (e.g., vision capabilities for poster scan)
  - Admin-only configuration (users cannot select models)
  - Models should be categorized by capabilities (vision-capable vs. text-only, etc.)

  - Support per-process prompt management
  - Include process-specific template systems with appropriate placeholders

- **Testing Environment**
  - Create dedicated testing area separate from main settings
  - Support A/B testing between different models/prompts
  - Allow saving test results for comparison

  - Support simple qualitative ratings by admins for response quality

- **Cost Management**
  - Implement per-model and per-process cost tracking
  - Provide cost budgeting/limits features
  - Include cost comparison visualizations between models
  - Support migration of historical cost analytics data from V1

## Implementation Sequence [AFTER DOCUMENTATION COMPLETION]

Once all documentation is complete, implementation should follow this sequence:

1. Development Environment Setup

   - Docker containers (PHP, MySQL, Redis, Node.js)
   - Configuration files and environment variables

2. Core Infrastructure
   - Database migrations
   - Authentication system implementation
   - Base middleware and service providers

3. UI Foundation
   - Base layouts and templates
   - Authentication views
   - Dashboard structure

4. Core Functionality
   - Media management
   - Event management
   - Social media content generation

5. Advanced Features
   - LLM integration
   - Analytics
   - Billing system

## Critical Project Rules [MUST FOLLOW]

- Maintain STRICT separation between user and admin interfaces in documentation and implementation
- Ensure screenshot references EXACTLY match actual filenames in the screenshots-of-v1 folder
- Focus on accurate documentation that reflects the ACTUAL implementation in the legacy XAMPP project
- Follow the implementation order and approach outlined in the Build Strategy document
- Ensure components with incomplete documentation are FULLY documented before implementation begins
- Do NOT begin implementation until ALL documentation is complete and verified
- Keep UI_COMPONENT_GAP_ANALYSIS.md and UI_COMPONENT_INVENTORY_REORGANIZED.md in sync at all times
