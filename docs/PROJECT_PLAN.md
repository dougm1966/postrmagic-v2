# PostrMagic V2 - Project Plan & Progress Tracker

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Foundation Setup & Core Models
- **Last Updated**: 2025-07-29
- **Environment**: Docker-based development with Laravel 11
- **Tests Status**: All tests passing (30 passed, 7 skipped) with expected warnings

## Build Strategy Overview
Based on the POSTRMAGIC_V2_BUILD_STRATEGY.md, we are following a phased approach:

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Models (IN PROGRESS)
- [x] Project initialization with Laravel 11
- [x] Docker containerization setup
- [x] Database schema design
- [x] Core model creation:
  - [x] Event model (with fillable fields, casts, validation, helper methods, scopes, relationships)
  - [x] MediaItem model (with Event relationship)
  - [x] GeneratedPost model (with Event relationship)
- [x] Database migrations
  - [x] Initial tables creation
  - [x] Foreign key relationships between Event, MediaItem, and GeneratedPost
- [x] Factory setup for testing
  - [x] Event factory
  - [x] MediaItem factory (with Event relationship)
  - [x] GeneratedPost factory (with Event relationship)
- [x] Test suite implementation
  - [x] Event model tests (creation, attributes, methods, scopes, relationships)
  - [x] Relationship tests with MediaItem and GeneratedPost
- [ ] Seeders for development data
- [ ] API endpoints for core models

### Phase 2: Authentication & User Management (PENDING)
- [ ] User model setup with roles and permissions
- [ ] Authentication system implementation
- [ ] User registration and profile management
- [ ] Admin dashboard for user management

### Phase 3: Core Event Management (PENDING)
- [ ] Event CRUD operations
- [ ] Event listing and filtering
- [ ] Event categories/tags
- [ ] Event search functionality

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (PENDING)
- [ ] Social media integration
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
- [ ] Notification system
- [ ] API development

### Phase 5: Polish & Deployment (PENDING)
- [ ] UI/UX refinements
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Production deployment
- [ ] Documentation completion

## Current Focus Areas
1. **Seeders and API Endpoints**: Finalizing seeders for development data and implementing API endpoints for core models
2. **Testing**: Maintaining comprehensive test coverage for Event functionality
3. **Database Compatibility**: Maintaining SQLite/MySQL dual compatibility

## Technical Decisions Made
- **Database**: SQLite for development, MySQL for production
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI for consistent, modern UI
- **Testing**: Feature tests for Event model functionality
- **Architecture**: Following Laravel best practices and conventions

## Recent Progress
- ✅ Completed Event model with fillable fields, casts, and helper methods
- ✅ Added validation rules and business logic to Event model
- ✅ Implemented relationships between Event and related models (MediaItem, GeneratedPost)
- ✅ Created migrations to add foreign key relationships
- ✅ All tests passing (11 passed for Event model)

## Next Immediate Tasks
1. Complete seeders for development data
2. Implement API endpoints for core models
3. Finalize Phase 1 documentation
4. Begin Phase 2: Authentication & User Management

## Test Status Summary
- **Passing**: 30 tests
- **Skipped**: 7 tests (expected - disabled Jetstream features)
- **Warnings**: PHPUnit deprecation warnings (low priority) + disabled feature warnings (expected)

## Notes & Considerations
- All development follows Docker-based workflow
- Maintaining backward compatibility within V2 (not with V1)
- Following established safety protocols for file operations
- Using propose_code tool for all code changes in chat mode
- Planning document and build strategy are aligned and current
