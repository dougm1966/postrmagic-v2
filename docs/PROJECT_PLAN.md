# PostrMagic V2 - Project Plan & Progress Tracker

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Foundation Setup & Core Models
- **Last Updated**: 2025-07-29
- **Environment**: Docker-based development with Laravel 11
- **Tests Status**: All tests passing (30 passed, 7 skipped) with expected warnings

## Build Strategy Overview
Based on the POSTRMAGIC_V2_BUILD_STRATEGY.md, we are following a phased approach:

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Models ðŸ”„ (In Progress)
- [x] Laravel 11 setup with Docker
- [x] Database configuration (SQLite dev, MySQL prod)
- [x] Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI integration
- [x] Database migrations run
- [x] Event model basic structure created (syntax fixed)
- [x] Event model tests passing
- [ ] Complete Event model with fillable fields, casts, and methods
- [ ] Event validation and business logic
- [ ] Event factories and seeders
- [ ] Event testing suite completion

### Phase 2: Authentication & User Management (Pending)
- [ ] Laravel Breeze implementation
- [ ] User registration/login
- [ ] Profile management
- [ ] Role-based permissions

### Phase 3: Core Event Management (Pending)
- [ ] Event CRUD operations
- [ ] Event listing and filtering
- [ ] Event categories/tags
- [ ] Event search functionality

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Pending)
- [ ] Social media integration
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
- [ ] Notification system
- [ ] API development

### Phase 5: Polish & Deployment (Pending)
- [ ] UI/UX refinements
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Production deployment
- [ ] Documentation completion

## Current Focus Areas
1. **Event Model Completion**: Adding fillable fields, casts, and helper methods
2. **Testing**: Maintaining comprehensive test coverage for Event functionality
3. **Database Compatibility**: Maintaining SQLite/MySQL dual compatibility

## Technical Decisions Made
- **Database**: SQLite for development, MySQL for production
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI for consistent, modern UI
- **Testing**: Feature tests for Event model functionality
- **Architecture**: Following Laravel best practices and conventions

## Recent Progress
- âœ… Fixed Event model syntax errors
- âœ… All tests passing (30 passed, 7 skipped)
- âœ… Event model basic structure working correctly

## Next Immediate Tasks
1. Complete Event model implementation with all required fields
2. Add Event model validation rules and business logic
3. Complete Event test suite
4. Move to Phase 2 (Authentication)

## Test Status Summary
- **Passing**: 30 tests
- **Skipped**: 7 tests (expected - disabled Jetstream features)
- **Warnings**: PHPUnit deprecation warnings (low priority) + disabled feature warnings (expected)

## Notes & Considerations
- All development follows Docker-based workflow
- Maintaining backward compatibility within V2 (not with V1)
- Following established safety protocols for file operations
- Using propose_code tool for all code changes in chat mode
- Planning document and build strategy are aligned and current
