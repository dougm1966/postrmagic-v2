## Code Block Usage Policy

**IMPORTANT:** Any code block in this documentation is meant to be copied and used exactly as shown—either as a terminal command or as file content. Code blocks will never contain examples, placeholders, or illustrative content. Any non-literal or reference content will appear outside code blocks.

## Dockerized Development Environment

**IMPORTANT:** All development, build, and CLI commands for PostrMagic V2 must be run inside Docker containers using `docker-compose exec`. Do NOT install PHP, Composer, Node, or MySQL on your host or WSL system. All services are fully containerized.

### Onboarding & Usage

1. **Start the Docker environment** (from the project root):
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Run Laravel Artisan commands** (from the project root):
   ```sh
   docker-compose exec laravel.test php artisan migrate
   docker-compose exec laravel.test php artisan make:model Example
   ```

3. **Install Composer dependencies**:
   ```sh
   docker-compose exec laravel.test composer install
   ```

4. **Run NPM/Yarn commands** (for asset building):
   ```sh
   docker-compose exec node npm install
   docker-compose exec node npm run dev
   ```

5. **Check logs**:
   ```sh
   docker-compose logs
   ```

6. **Stop the environment**:
   ```sh
   docker-compose down
   ```

**Never run PHP, Composer, or Node commands directly on your host or WSL system. Always use Docker.**

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.
