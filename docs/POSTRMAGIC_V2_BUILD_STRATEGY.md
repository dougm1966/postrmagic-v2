## 1. Pre-Development Planning

### 1.1. Documentation Completion

Before beginning development, ensure all documentation is complete:

- [x] UI Component Inventory (`UI_COMPONENT_INVENTORY_REORGANIZED.md`)
- [x] UI Component Gap Analysis (`UI_COMPONENT_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`)
- [x] Complete the placeholder sections in the UI Component Inventory:
  - [x] Billing & Subscription Management (Section 4.2)
  - [x] Admin Analytics Dashboard (Section 5.1)
  - [x] LLM Settings & Management Interface (Section 5.2)
- [ ] Capture all required screenshots from V1 system

### 1.2. Environment Setup

- [ ] Create standardized development environment configuration
- [ ] Set up Laravel 12 project skeleton
- [ ] Configure Docker development environment with:
  - PHP 8.1+ container
  - MySQL/MariaDB container
  - Redis container (for cache/queue)
  - Node.js container (for asset compilation)
- [ ] Create `.env.example` with all required variables
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline integration

### 1.3. Technology Stack Selection

Finalize and document technology choices:

| Component | V1 Implementation | V2 Implementation |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Frontend Framework | Plain JavaScript + jQuery | Vue.js or Livewire |
| CSS Framework | Tailwind (CDN) | Tailwind (npm) |
| Authentication | Custom PHP | Laravel Fortify/Jetstream |
| Database | SQLite/MySQL | Laravel Eloquent with MySQL |
| File Storage | Local filesystem | Laravel Filesystem (local/S3) |
| API Authentication | Custom | Laravel Sanctum |
| Task Scheduling | Cron jobs | Laravel Scheduler |
| Queue System | None | Laravel Queue with Redis |
| Email | PHP mail() | Laravel Mail with SMTP |
| LLM Integration | Custom PHP classes | Laravel Services with Queues |

## 2. Data Migration Strategy

### 2.1. Database Schema Mapping

Create a detailed mapping between V1 and V2 database schemas:

| V1 Table/Column | V2 Migration/Model | Transformation Required |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| users | User model + migration | Add timestamps, UUID, remember token |
| user_sessions | Handled by Laravel | None - use Laravel's built-in session |
| events | Event model + migration | Add proper relationship definitions |
| user_media | Media model + migration | Add soft deletes, metadata fields |
| llm_providers | LlmProvider model + migration | Add created_by, configuration JSON |
| llm_configurations | LlmConfiguration model + migration | Add validation rules |
| llm_usage_logs | LlmUsageLog model + migration | Add request/response storage |

### 2.2. Data Transformation Plan

Document necessary data transformations:

- [ ] User password rehashing (from md5/custom to Laravel's bcrypt)
- [ ] Media path restructuring (from flat directory to hierarchical)
- [ ] Sanitization of user input data
- [ ] Normalization of inconsistent data formats
- [ ] Migration of file attachments to new storage structure

### 2.3. Migration Scripts

- [ ] Create Laravel migration files for each database table
- [ ] Develop custom Artisan commands for data import
- [ ] Build data validation and cleanup scripts
- [ ] Develop rollback capabilities for each migration step

### 2.4. Testing Strategy for Data Migration

- [ ] Create data integrity verification scripts
- [ ] Set up staging environment with anonymized production data
- [ ] Develop metrics for successful migration validation
