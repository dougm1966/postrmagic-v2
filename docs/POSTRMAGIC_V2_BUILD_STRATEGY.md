# PostrMagic V2: Build & Implementation Strategy

## Code Block Usage Policy

**All code blocks in this documentation are literal and must be copied and used exactly as shown. No examples, placeholders, or illustrative content will ever be in a code block. Only commands or file contents intended for direct use will appear in code blocks.**


This document outlines the comprehensive build and implementation strategy for creating PostrMagic V2, a modern Laravel 12 application. It serves as a roadmap for the development team to ensure a structured, systematic, and successful implementation.

---

**ALL environment setup and CLI commands (Artisan, Composer, NPM, etc.) must be run inside Docker containers using `docker-compose exec`. Never run PHP, Composer, or Node commands directly on your host or WSL system.**

---

> **Important Note:** PostrMagic V2 is a complete fresh build with its own architecture and design. 
>
> **Backward Compatibility:** Throughout this document, "backward compatibility" refers only to ensuring that each new development phase or feature maintains compatibility with previously implemented components within the V2 project itself. This means new features should not break existing V2 functionality, database schema changes should preserve existing V2 data structures, and API modifications should maintain support for endpoints already implemented in V2.

## 1. Pre-Development Planning

### 1.1. Documentation Completion

Before beginning development, ensure all documentation is complete:

- [x] UI Component Inventory (`UI_COMPONENT_INVENTORY_REORGANIZED.md`)
- [x] UI Component Gap Analysis (`UI_COMPONENT_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`)
- [x] Complete the placeholder sections in the UI Component Inventory:
  - [x] Billing & Subscription Management (Section 4.2)
  - [x] Admin Analytics Dashboard (Section 5.1)
  - [x] LLM Settings & Management Interface (Section 5.2)
- [x ] Capture all required screenshots for reference

### 1.2. Environment Setup

**All setup steps below must be performed using Docker containers. Use `docker-compose exec` for all CLI commands. Do not install or run PHP, Composer, Node, or MySQL directly on your host or WSL system.**

- [x] Create standardized development environment configuration
- [x] Set up Laravel 12 project skeleton
- [x] Configure Docker development environment with sequential setup:
  1. PHP 8.4 container (Primary)
  2. MySQL/MariaDB container (Depends on PHP)
  3. Redis container (for cache/queue) (Depends on PHP)
  4. Node.js container (for asset compilation) (Depends on PHP)
- [x] Create `.env.example` with all required variables
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline integration
- [x] Verify container intercommunication and connectivity
- [ ] Create environment bootstrap script for new developers

### 1.3. Technology Stack Selection

Finalize and document technology choices:

| Component | Current Implementation |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Frontend Framework | Vue.js or Livewire |
| CSS Framework | Tailwind (npm) |
| Authentication | Laravel Fortify/Jetstream |
| Database | Laravel Eloquent with MySQL |
| File Storage | Laravel Filesystem (local/S3) |
| API Authentication | Laravel Sanctum |
| Task Scheduling | Laravel Scheduler |
| Queue System | Laravel Queue with Redis |
| Email | Laravel Mail with SMTP |
| LLM Integration | Laravel Services with Queues |

## 2. API Specification

> **Important Note:** PostrMagic V2 follows an API-first development approach. All API endpoints must be fully documented with request/response formats before implementation begins.

### 2.1. API Design Principles

- RESTful API design with resource-based URLs
- API versioning through URL prefix (e.g., `/api/v1/resources`)
- Authentication via Laravel Sanctum
- JSON:API compliant responses
- Consistent error handling and status codes
- Proper pagination for list endpoints
- Field selection and filtering capabilities where appropriate

### 2.2. API Documentation Standards

All endpoints must be documented with:
- Complete URL with HTTP method
- Authentication requirements
- Request parameters (path, query, body) with data types and validation rules
- Expected response format with status codes
- Error scenarios and error response formats
- Example requests and responses
